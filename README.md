# Year 2 Portfolio (portfolio_rhythm)

This is a personal portfolio by me to not only showcase my skills and accomplishments but to also showcase my love for rhythm games and how much they have affected my life for the better.

This project has taken a month of my life to create, which for its quality, I'd say I did pretty good. Using an entirely new software with an entirely new language to create something I've only dreamed about.
